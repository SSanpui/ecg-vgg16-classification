# ecg-vgg16-classification
This repository contains reproducible code for diagnising Arrhythmia by integrating ECG Spectrograms with Deep Learning methods. The VGG16-based transfer learning framework demonstrates robust performance for multi-class ECG arrhythmia classification. While current validation is limited to the MIT-BIH dataset, results establish technical feasibility for clinical decision support applications, pending prospective validation on
